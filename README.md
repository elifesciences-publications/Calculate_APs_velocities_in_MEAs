# Calculate_APs_velocities_in_MEAs
MATLAB script for calculating action potentials propagation velocities using spikes timestamps in specified electrodes in a MEA device (coupled with microfluidics)

This script is associated with the publication

Ana Rita Costa et al, "The membrane periodic skeleton is an actomyosin network that regulates axonal diameter and conduction", 2020



To use the script run the file: Analyse_APs_Propagating_Velocities_From_Spikes_Timestamps.m

Sample data is provided to test the script: SampleData_SpikesTimes_and_ElecLabels.mat
